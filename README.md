# Schema Design
---
Create a database schema that will represent People, their Location, and their Interests. This database is intended to be used to connect individuals who are in the same location and share interests.

## Steps
---
1. Create the three required tables (Person, Location, & Interest) along with any required join tables. Include the following listed columns in the designated tables, along with any additional columns required for join statements.
  * Person
    - Id (Primary Key)
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Age
  * Location
    - Id (Primary Key)
    - City
    - State
    - Country
  * Interest
    - Id (Primary Key)
    - Title
    
2. Set all Id fields to be autogenerated primary keys.
3. Add join columns and tables as necessary to ensure that:
  - A Person can have any number of interests
  - A Person must have one location
4. Write a SQL query that will find all Person entries that share a specified Interest and have the same specified Location (The Interest & Location can be hard coded during testing, this will be parameterized later).

## My Join

```sql
SELECT 
    concat(t2.first_name, ' ', t2.last_name) person_name,
    concat(t2.city, ', ', t2.state, ', ', t2.country) person_location,
    t2.title interest
FROM (
    -- sub-query selects the location_id and interest_id from the joined tables where the counts are greater than 1
    (SELECT
        l.location_id,
        pi.interest_id
    FROM location_table l
        JOIN person p ON (l.location_id = p.location_id)
        JOIN person_interest pi ON (pi.person_id = p.person_id)
        JOIN interest i ON (pi.interest_id = i.interest_id)
    GROUP BY
        l.location_id,
        pi.interest_id
    HAVING count(*) > 1)
    ) t1
    -- sub-query selects columns from the person, interest, and location table to join with the previous subquery so that more columns are shown in final output
    JOIN (
        SELECT
            p.first_name,
            p.last_name,
            l.city,
            l.state,
            l.country,
            l.location_id,
            i.interest_id,
            i.title 
        FROM location_table l
            JOIN person p ON (l.location_id = p.location_id)
            JOIN person_interest pi ON (pi.person_id = p.person_id)
            JOIN interest i ON (pi.interest_id = i.interest_id)) t2 
    ON (t1.location_id = t2.location_id
        AND t1.interest_id = t2.interest_id)
ORDER BY t2.title;
```
